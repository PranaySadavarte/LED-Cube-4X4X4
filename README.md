# LED-Cube-4X4X4
•	This project is made using a group of 64 LEDs in a grid of 4X4X4, with commonly connected cathodes and anodes in the shape of a cube.
•	It has 16 terminals to handle the 16 (4*4) columns and 3 terminals to control the rows/levels.
•	A well-timed code of just blinking LEDs can be made interesting using this technique.
•	All the LEDs can be controlled individually and delays can be set accordingly to make beautiful patterns over a 3d cube.
